aws hosting

 ssh -i "C:\Users\ACHINTYA\Downloads\docker-poc.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-200-166-63.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Activate virtaul env ( gunicorn already check if required, restart nginx server if required)
 sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default   (configure port and location)

sudo systemctl start/stop flask_test (gunicorn sevice name   - use same for nginx)

Run flask db upgrade first (pip install mysqlclient was the issue)
			   (change SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI if there is an issue)
Also ldap server registration is disabled for now
Cause of delays-
-Deployment procedure- first establishing connection with server using ssh
-Localhost link conversion using reverse proxy (reverse proxy configuration file was a pain in the ass)
-Generating a service to run the app continously (gunicorn - create a wsgi.py file for that)
-Database configuration (first with on serve local database)
-Then to different port based db.
